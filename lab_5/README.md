## Post-Lab Reflection
- It felt more simpler and intuitive to create a list.  Flutter's refactoring feature lets us turn a list into a widget class, so we can further costomize the behaviour of each card item in the list.  Despite Android Studio's visual editor, we felt the performance was slow and tedious.  Flutter is the opposite.
- Android Studio navigation and data passing required a different .xml for each page.  Flutter's tree-based approach has it so that navigating and data passing was as easy as passing variables into a function.  As such, it was less time consuming to build.
- Android Studio felt trickier to use, having to anchor elements or else they would appear off in the emulator.  Flutter's scaffolding approach did that heavy lifting, requiring basic knowledge of HTML elements and organization.  With Flutter, we felt more confident that our items would appear as we'd want it to.
- There wasn't much boilerplating in Flutter, whereas in Android studio, you needed to declare an item by its ID in order to manipulate it, which needed to be repeated throughout multiple functions.  
- Flutter was much more responsive and easier to run on our machines, since we were able to run it on a virtual windows or web browser, rather than having to emulate an entire phone like in Android Studio.  It also had hot reloading, which was convenient when trying to adjust the appearence of the UI elements.
